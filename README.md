# AI Assignment 2: Search and Optimization

This project implements four classic search and optimization algorithms to solve problems in various environments.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members

- **Pashaula Eswar Sai** - CS24M109
- **Gooty Bharadwaj** - CS24M123

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented

- **Branch and Bound (BnB)**
- **Iterative Deepening A\***
- **Hill Climbing (HC)**
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**

## ðŸ§ª Environments Used

### For **Branch and Bound** & **Iterative Deepening A\***
- Frozen Lake Environment: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/

### For **Hill Climbing** & **Simulated Annealing**
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): https://github.com/g-dendiev/gym_TSP

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Descriptions

- **Frozen Lake / Ant Maze**: Navigation tasks for BnB and IDA*, aiming to reach the goal with optimal path-finding under stochasticity.
- **TSP**: An optimization problem where the agent must visit all cities exactly once with minimum travel distance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Running these files is really simpleâ€”just upload the `.ipynb` files to Google Colab and execute them directly.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Criteria

- **Performance Metrics**: Reward, time, and point of convergence.
- **Repetitions**: Each algorithm is tested at least 5 times.
- **Timeout Handling**: Execution is terminated if the algorithm does not converge within 10 minutes.
- **Visualizations**: Execution gifs are included for presentation purposes.
- **Heuristics**: Each search algorithm includes a clearly defined heuristic function.
